## Feature-Sliced Design

### Naming conventions

- **app** - root Next.js folder for routes
- **src** - root folder for source code
- **src/core** - app-wide settings, styles and providers. (e.g. theme, global styles, providers)
- **src/views** - compositional layer to construct full pages from entities, features and widgets.
- **src/widgets** - compositional layer to combine entities and features into meaningful blocks. (e.g. IssuesList,
  UserProfile)
- **src/features** - user interactions, actions that bring business value to the user. (e.g. SendComment, AddToCart,
  UsersSearch)
- **src/entities** - business entities. (e.g., User, Product, Order)
- **src/shared** - reusable functionality, detached from the specifics of the project/business. (e.g. UIKit, libs, API)

### Folders can contain:

- **api** - Segment: API-logic (services)
- **ui** - Segment: UI-logic (components)
- **model** - Segment: Business-logic (slices, thunks, types)
- **types** - Segment: Types (interfaces, types, enums)
- **lib** - Segment: Libs (utils, helpers, etc.)
